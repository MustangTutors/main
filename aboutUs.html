                <p>The Altshuler Learning Enhancement Center (A-LEC) at Southern Methodist University is an extraordinarily useful service where students of the university can go on a drop-in basis to seek tutoring for any subject. Unfortunately, the service is not user-friendly; students have to physically go to the A-LEC to see if a tutor is available for a subject. If there are no available tutors, the students have to wait at the center potentially for hours. Even if a student knows a particular tutor’s schedule, there is no guarantee that the tutor will be present or available when the student arrives. Additionally, students, tutors, and parents have no easy way to view a record of a student’s meetings with a tutor.
                <br><br>
                Our product, Mustang Tutors, addresses all of these issues and allows the A-LEC to more adequately utilize its potential. Each tutor will have a profile with all of his/her relevant information. Tutors will be able to check-in, providing an accurate account of their availability. Students will be able to search for available tutors who can tutor them for a class, and students can rate and review tutors who have helped them, providing the A-LEC with a form of quality control. Mustang Tutors will revolutionize the way that SMU students get help in their classes from the A-LEC.
